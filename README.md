## Local Development

Node.js LTS or greater required.

```bash

# current package name aliases: {frontend, contracts}
```

### Testing

### Code Linting

Linting is setup for `JavaScript` with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

    # lint solidity contracts
    $ yarn run contracts:prettier

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.
